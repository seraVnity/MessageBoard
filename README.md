This is a "Message Board".

#ADD message
You can add your message via the button "Подать" taking into consideration that there are 2 required fields you need to compile before submission.
  * The image is uploaded when the button "Прикрепить фото" is white. 
    If you decide to change your image while submission, you can reupload your image by pressing the button.

#DELETE message
You can delete your message from the board by the button "Удалить".

#STORAGE of files
The messages are uploaded to local storage as for the requirements of the test task.

The messages are uploaded to local storage one by one with the ids as I considered it to be clearer and easier to then operate with deletion and listing of them.
